# Data Story: How Incentive Programs Improve Business Performance

In the competitive world of insurance, **sales incentives** play a crucial role in boosting business growth. To make
smart decisions, it’s important to know how these programs affect key numbers like **AFYP** (Annualized First Year
Premium), **AFYC** (Annualized First Year Commission), and the total **policy count**. This story walks through how
incentive programs impact business performance, offering insights for leadership to improve future strategies.

---

## Objective:1. Performance Overview: Understanding the Basics

We start by looking at the overall performance. Key metrics like **AFYP**, **AFYC**, and **policy count** give a quick
idea of the company’s success and how incentive programs influence the business.

- **AFYP** and **AFYC** show how much premium and commission were earned during the incentive period.
- The total number of **policies sold** shows the company’s growth in terms of new business.

This initial view sets the stage for understanding how incentives affect the business as we dive deeper.

---

## Objective:2. Incentive Program Impact: Boosting Growth

Sales incentives are key to motivating teams and improving performance. By examining specific programs like **Quarterly
Quest** and **Monthly Heroes**, we see which strategies work best.

- Under **Quarterly Quest**, we saw a big increase in **AFYP** in branches that were previously underperforming.
- **Monthly Heroes** boosted **AFYC** (commission), but some regions did better than others.

These insights help sales managers and leaders understand which programs are most successful, allowing them to invest in
the best strategies going forward.

---

## Objective:3. Branch & TR Code Performance: Finding Top Performers

Branch and sales representative (TR) performance are critical to success. By identifying which branches and reps perform
well during incentives, we can replicate that success in other areas.

- **Branch A** and **Branch C** stood out as top performers, contributing significantly to **AFYP**.
- Top sales reps in these branches had higher-than-average **AFYC**, showing how targeted incentives can drive better
  results.

These findings help leaders repeat what works in underperforming areas by adjusting incentive programs to increase
engagement.

---

## Objective:4. Time-Based Analysis: Comparing Before and After Incentives

To see the real impact of incentive programs, we need to look at how performance changes before and after the incentives
are launched. Tracking these changes over time shows the effects on policy sales and commissions.

- Before **Quarterly Quest** began, growth in **AFYP** was flat. After it launched, both **AFYP** and policy count saw a
  sharp rise.
- **AFYC** continued to grow in the months following the program, showing its long-term impact.

This analysis helps decision-makers adjust future programs based on what works best over time.

---

## Objective:5. Causal Impact Analysis: Measuring True Effectiveness

To fully measure the effectiveness of incentive programs, we need more than just basic numbers. **Causal impact analysis
**, like **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)**, helps us see the real effects of these programs.

- **DiD analysis** shows that branches in the **Monthly Heroes** program had 15% higher growth in **AFYP** than those
  that didn’t participate.
- The **Quarterly Quest** program brought in an additional $X in premiums, clearly tied to the incentive.

This gives leadership confidence in knowing which programs work best and how to improve future strategies.

---

## Objective:6. Product Group Analysis: Insights by Product Type

Incentives not only increase overall sales, but they also drive growth in specific product categories. By looking at *
*AFYP** and **AFYC** across different product groups, we can see which products benefited most.

- **Life Insurance** products saw the biggest boost, while **Savings** products showed smaller gains, indicating areas
  with potential for growth.

These insights allow product managers to refine future incentive programs, either focusing on underperforming products
or further promoting high-demand ones.

## Actionable Steps

1. **Replicate Success in Weaker Branches**: Use the incentive strategies that worked well in **Branch A** and apply
   them to other, lower-performing areas.
2. **Tailor Future Incentives**: Use the insights from program and product performance to design incentives that boost
   both policy count and commissions.
3. **Monitor Long-Term Effects**: Keep tracking performance after the programs to see if the improvements last and
   adjust incentives accordingly.
4. **Diversify Product Focus**: Design incentives that encourage growth in underperforming product categories, helping
   create a more balanced product mix.
